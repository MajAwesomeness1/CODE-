For The homepage, we wanted the About the store on one central location with pictures so we made this homepage to do just that.
The style is mostly consistent across all the tabs except for the Baskin Robbins tab. 
For pizzas tab, we wanted to keep the style consistent so we kept the same color and font and we made a little menu where you can select what u want and it will tel you what is in that pizza.
For the Menu Tab, we wanted to make an actual good looking menu so we made diffrent sections to represent diffrent foods.
For locations we just put google maps on the page with the pysical address.
For the gas tab, we just looked up the gas prices and we change them everyday.
The reason why the Baskin Robbins Tab is a diffrent color is to show the diffrence between what the stores have to offer. The tabs with the consistent colors is what a usual gas station has in it. Not many gas stations have a ice cream shop within the store so thats why its diffrent.
